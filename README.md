== DESCRIPTION ==

"The morning type" is quite possibly the worst pun I have ever made. Ever. 

In the game, you type. And it is morning. The game is intended to help with two things: Increasing your vocabulary and / or help you practice typing quickly. So it falls into the educational genre. 

Now let me acknowledge that it basically has nothing to do with the theme. My original idea did... then again, my original idea also featured a character, viewed in third person. So yeah, the "unconventional weapon" side of it faded away during development. While I acknowledge this, I think it's fair to allow you to express your displeasure on this fact by letting you vote in the "mood" category, so that you hopefully will not penalize the game in the other categories for its extremely liberal interpretation of the theme. Thanks! 

All feedback is welcome, especially written comments! If you would like me to look at your game, leave a comment and I will! :D
